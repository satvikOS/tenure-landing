          <p>
            These terms cover how you and your organization may use Tenure while
            the product is in early access. We&rsquo;ve kept them short and plain
            on purpose. If anything here is unclear, write to us and we&rsquo;ll
            explain it directly.
          </p>

          <h2>Acceptance of these terms</h2>
          <p>
            By creating an account or using Tenure, you agree to these terms on
            behalf of yourself and the organization you represent. If you don&rsquo;t
            agree, please don&rsquo;t use the service. If you&rsquo;re accepting on
            behalf of an organization, you confirm you have the authority to do so.
          </p>

          <h2>The service</h2>
          <p>
            Tenure is an early-stage product offered through a pilot and early
            access. It is the institutional-memory layer for organizations whose
            leadership turns over &mdash; it captures knowledge as work happens and
            sits on top of the tools you already use. Because it&rsquo;s still being
            built with the organizations who use it, features may change, appear, or
            be removed as we learn what actually serves the handoff.
          </p>

          <h2>Your account and content</h2>
          <p>
            You are responsible for your account and for keeping your login secure.
            You&rsquo;re responsible for the activity that happens under it, so let us
            know promptly if you think someone else has access.
          </p>
          <p>
            You keep ownership of the content your organization stores in Tenure.
            We don&rsquo;t claim it as ours. We process it only to provide and improve
            the service for you, as described in our Privacy notice.
          </p>

          <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>
            Use Tenure for its purpose &mdash; building and passing on your
            organization&rsquo;s record. Please don&rsquo;t:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Misuse, disrupt, or attempt to break the service or its security.</li>
            <li>Breach the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property.</li>
            <li>Upload unlawful content, or content you don&rsquo;t have the right to share.</li>
            <li>
              Use the service to harm, harass, or impersonate others, or to send spam.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Organizational data and ownership</h2>
          <p>
            The record belongs to the organization, not to any one person who held a
            seat. When leadership changes hands, access passes to the inheriting board.
            Individuals who created entries don&rsquo;t take the record with them when
            their term ends &mdash; that&rsquo;s the whole point. We&rsquo;ll work with
            an organization&rsquo;s current leadership to manage access and transfers.
          </p>

          <h2>Availability and changes</h2>
          <p>
            During the pilot, Tenure is provided as-is. We may modify, add, or pause
            features as the product develops, and we may take the service offline for
            maintenance or improvements. We don&rsquo;t guarantee uninterrupted or
            error-free availability while we&rsquo;re still building. We&rsquo;ll give
            organizations reasonable notice of significant changes when we can.
          </p>

          <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;re an early-stage team doing our honest best to keep your record
            safe and useful, but we can&rsquo;t promise the service will be perfect. To
            the extent the law allows, Tenure isn&rsquo;t liable for indirect or
            consequential losses arising from using the service during the pilot. None
            of this limits any rights you have that can&rsquo;t be waived under
            applicable law. Keep your own copies of anything truly critical.
          </p>

          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>
            You can stop using Tenure at any time, and an organization can ask us to
            close its account and return or delete its record. We may suspend or end
            access if these terms are seriously or repeatedly broken, or if we need to
            for security or legal reasons. If we end your access, we&rsquo;ll give your
            organization a fair chance to retrieve its record where we reasonably can.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
          <p>
            As Tenure grows beyond the pilot, these terms will evolve with it. When we
            make a meaningful change, we&rsquo;ll update the date above and let active
            organizations know. Continuing to use the service after a change means you
            accept the updated terms.
          </p>
