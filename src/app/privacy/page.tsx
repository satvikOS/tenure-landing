          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Tenure is an early-stage product built to hold an organization&rsquo;s
            institutional memory — the contacts, decisions, and playbooks that
            usually disappear when leadership turns over. This page explains, in
            plain terms, what information we collect, how we use it, and the
            choices you have. We&rsquo;ll keep it honest and update it as the
            product grows.
          </p>

          <h2>Information we collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account details you provide</strong> — things like your
              name, email, role, and the organization you belong to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The knowledge you choose to store</strong> — the records,
              notes, files, and history your organization decides to keep in
              Tenure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic usage data</strong> — the operational information we
              need to run the service reliably and keep it secure.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How we use information</h2>
          <p>
            We use the information to run Tenure, support your organization, and
            improve how the product works. We do not sell personal information.
            We use it to deliver the service you&rsquo;re asking for — not to
            build a business out of your data.
          </p>

          <h2>Who can see your information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Your organization&rsquo;s members</strong>, and the boards
              that inherit the record when a term ends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not the public.</strong> Your record is private to your
              organization by default.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service providers we rely on</strong> to operate Tenure —
              for example, hosting and infrastructure — under confidentiality
              obligations, and only as needed to run the service.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who owns the information</h2>
          <p>
            The organization owns its record. That&rsquo;s the whole point of
            Tenure: knowledge belongs to the seat, not the person who held it.
            Individuals do not take the record with them when their term ends —
            it carries forward to whoever inherits the role.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use reasonable safeguards to protect the information in Tenure. No
            method of storing or transmitting data is perfectly secure, and we
            can&rsquo;t promise absolute security — but we take the trust your
            organization places in us seriously and work to earn it.
          </p>

          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <p>
            You can request access to the information we hold about you, ask for
            an export, or request deletion. The simplest way is to contact us and
            tell us what you need; we&rsquo;ll work with you and your organization
            to honor the request.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            As Tenure develops, we may update this policy to reflect how the
            product actually works. When we make a meaningful change, we&rsquo;ll
            update the date at the top of this page so you can see when it last
            changed.
          </p>

          <h2>Contact</h2>
